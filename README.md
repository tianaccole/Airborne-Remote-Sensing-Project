This is my undergraduate research project from working in the Cohen Lab at UC Berkeley with graduate student mentor Naomi Asimow. The data used for this project was provided by [The Aerospace Corporation](https://aerospace.org/), with guidance from [Buckland et al. (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0034425717304212?via%3Dihub) for quantification methodology.
